    "text": "News\n\nDecember 19, 2025 — Inverse Days\nI just returned from Inverse Days in Helsinki, Finland. This was my second time attending, and both times it has been the highlight of my year.\nWith the help of my European friends and collaborators, particularly my mentor Matti Lassas, I was able to map out my research program and goals for 2026. These projects will explore new connections between disparate areas of applied mathematics, and I am excited to share them this year.\nAlso, it was great to spend time with many people I had only met briefly before, and also to finally meet in person several people who I had only known through their name and work.\nSomehow, I forgot to take even a single picture in Helsinki, so my memories will have to suffice.\n\n\nDecember 12, 2025 — CBMS\nI had the pleasure of attending the CBMS Conference on Research at the Interface of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning (AMML) 2025 at the University of Houston. The highlight of the conference was a 10 lecture series by Lars Ruthotto on machine learning and AI. Lars is an excellent presenter, and I will use his slides as a inspiration for my own talks. The lecture material and recordings are publically available.\n I presented a poster on our ongoing work regarding measure flows in Bayes Hilbert spaces. For this poster, I had some time to experiment with an unorthodox “darkmode” color scheme. It received positive feedback. The printer did not reproduce the colors exactly as I intended, but I am happy with the result.\nThe poster was made with Beamer using the Gemini template; you can find my color scheme here. If you are thinking of using it for your own posters, pease keep in mind the warnings at the bottom of the README.\nI expect the preprint for this work to be available on ArXiV by February 2026."

## News

### December 19, 2025 {#dec-19-2025}
I just returned from [*Inverse Days*](https://fips.fi/inverse-days-2025/) in Helsinki, Finland. This was my second time attending, and both times it has been the highlight of my year.


### December 12, 2025 {#dec-12-2025}
I had the pleasure of attending the [*CBMS Conference on Research at the Interface of Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning (AMML) 2025*](https://www.math.uh.edu/cbms-amml/) at the University of Houston. The highlight of the conference was a 10 lecture series by [Lars Ruthotto](https://www.math.emory.edu/~lruthot/) on machine learning and AI. Lars is an excellent presenter, and I will use his slides as a inspiration for my own talks. The [lecture material](https://www.math.emory.edu/~lruthot/workshops/computational-math-ai-2025/) and [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPre92Pl4X2A5xj5-nNWU1r1pAuwykI1V) are publically available.

I presented a poster on our ongoing work regarding measure flows in Bayes Hilbert spaces. For this poster, I had some time to experiment with an unorthodox "darkmode" color scheme. It received positive feedback. The printer did not reproduce the colors exactly as I intended, but I am happy with the result. The poster was made with Beamer using the [Gemini template](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini); you can find my color scheme [here](https://github.com/davidMis/gemini-darkmode). If you are thinking of using it for your own posters, pease keep in mind the warnings at the bottom of the README.
